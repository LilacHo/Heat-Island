"""
The 'height_acquire' module provides a comprehensive suite of functions for 
acquire and processing geographic data, specifically focusing on building 
heights, based on https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints. 
Key functionalities in the module include acquiring building heights within 
specific areas, calculating geometric centers of shapes, and performing 
weighted statistical analyses on geographical data. 

Key Functions:
- `height_acquire`: Acquires building height data from a specified hexagonal 
    area and returns a GeoDataFrame with these heights.
- `get_centroid`: Computes and adds the centroid of geometries in a GeoDataFrame.
- Statistical helper functions (`weighted_median`, `weighted_percentile`, `weighted_std`): 
    Provide statistical analysis tools for weighted data.
- `average_building_height_with_centroid`: Calculates various statistical 
    measures for building heights within a specified hexagon area.

Example Usage:
To use this module, first create a hexagonal area of interest using `create_hexagon` 
function from `heat_island.geo_process`, and then pass this hexagon to `height_acquire` 
to retrieve building heights within the area.

def height_acquire(hexagon):
    """
    Acquires building height data from a specified hexagonal area.

    This function takes a hexagon polygon as input, checks its validity,
    and expands its bounds slightly. It then generates a set of quad 
    keys for tiles within these bounds at a specific zoom level. For 
    each quad key, the function queries a dataset, reads the correspond
    -ing GeoJSON data, and creates a GeoDataFrame that includes building
    heights. It finally concatenates all GeoDataFrames for each quad key
    into one combined GeoDataFrame, which it returns.

    Parameters:
        hexagon (shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon): 
        A hexagon polygon representing the area of interest (AOI).

    Returns:
        gpd.GeoDataFrame: A GeoDataFrame containing the heights of 
        buildings within the specified hexagon area.

    Raises:

        there are issues with data retrieval based on quad keys.

def weighted_median(data, weights):

    Calculate the weighted median of a dataset.

    This function computes the weighted median for a given set of data

    calculates the cumulative sum of the weights, and then finds the value 
    at which half of the total weight is accumulated. This value is the 
    weighted median.

    Parameters:
    data (array-like): An array, list, or similar structure containing 
    the data points. The data should be numeric.
    weights (array-like): An array, list, or similar structure containing 
    the weights corresponding to each data point. These should be non-negative

    >>> weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> weighted_median(data, weights)
    4.0

    Note:
    The weighted median is a measure of central tendency, similar to the 
    median, but each data point contributes to the final result according 
    to its associated weight. This is particularly useful in situations 
    where some data points are more significant than others.

    and weights are sorted, and the cumulative weights are calculated. The 
    function then finds the data point at which the cumulative weight equals 
    the specified percentile of the total weight.

    Parameters:
    data (array-like): An array, list, or similar structure containing 
    the data points. The data should be numeric.
    weights (array-like): An array, list, or similar structure containing 
    the weights corresponding to each data point. These should be non-negative 
    numbers and of the same length as the data array.
    percentile (float): The desired percentile to calculate. This should be a 
    number between 0 and 100.

    Note:
    The weighted percentile, like the weighted median, accounts for the 
    significance of each data point through its weight. This is useful in 
    datasets where certain observations are more important or frequent 
    than others. The percentile argument allows for flexibility in 
    determining the specific percentile value needed.

def weighted_std(data, weights):

    Calculate the weighted standard deviation of a dataset.

    This function computes the weighted standard deviation for a given set 
    of data points and their associated weights. The weighted standard 
    deviation is a measure of the spread of a set of numbers, where each 
    number's contribution to the spread is weighted. The function calculates 
    the weighted average (mean) of the data, computes the weighted variance 
    as the average of the squared deviations from the weighted mean, and 
    then returns the square root of the variance as the standard deviation.

    Parameters:
    data (array-like): An array, list, or similar structure containing 
    the data points. The data should be numeric.
    weights (array-like): An array, list, or similar structure containing 
    the weights corresponding to each data point. These should be non-negative

    Note:
    The weighted standard deviation is useful in datasets where different 
    observations have varying levels of importance, represented by the 
    weights. This method differs from the traditional standard deviation 
    as it takes into account the weight of each data point, offering a 
    more nuanced view of data variability.

    height-area product, average height relative to the hexagon area, 
    weighted average height, and weighted statistical measures like 
    standard deviation and percentiles.
